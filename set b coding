question 1
1) Help Sheeba out 									    10 marks

Sheeba was asked by a Recruiter to write down 100 numbers (1-100) randomly 
but making sure that no number is repeated twice. At the end, the Recruiter found 
out that Sheeba had done her work perfectly, but committed just one mistake of 
repeating a number twice. Recruiter asked Sheeba that she recruiter her only 
under one condition! If Sheeba is able to find out the only number which she is 
repeated in an optimised manner.

Can you write a pseudocode, which can help Sheeba to find out the number which 
got repeated twice?


int repeatedonce(int *arr,int n)
{
int i,sum1=0,sum2;
sum2=(100*101)/2;
for(i=0,i<n;i++)
sum1=sum1+arr[i];

repeat=abs(sum2-sum1);

return repaet;
}









question 3

3) Closest to zero 									    20 Marks

This problem is also called minimum absolute sum pair. You are given an array of integers, containing both +ve and -ve numbers. You need to find the two elements such that their sum is closest to zero. eg. Array [15, 5, -20, 30, -45] Output should be 15, -20.

Note: We want the sum to be closest to zero not minimum. The minimum in the above example would be (-20, -45), but that is incorrect.


METHOD 1 O(N*N) COMPLEXITY
For each element find the sum of it with every other element in the array and compare sum. Finally, return the minimum sum

METHOD 2 (Sorting) 

1) Sort all the elements of the input array.
2) Use two index variables l and r to traverse from left and right ends respectively. Initialize l as 0 and r as n-1.
3) sum = a[l] + a[r]
4) If sum is -ve, then l++
5) If sum is +ve, then râ€“
6) Keep track of abs min sum.
7) Repeat steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 while l < r Implementation


# include <stdio.h>
# include <math.h>

void minAbsSumPair(int arr[], int n)
{
  
  int sum, min_sum = 65536;
 
  int l = 0, r = n-1;
 
  
  int min_l = l, min_r = n-1;
 
 
  if(n < 2)
  {
    printf("Invalid Input");
    return;
